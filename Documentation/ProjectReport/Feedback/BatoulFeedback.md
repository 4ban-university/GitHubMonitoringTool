This project allowed me to work with people I've never met before. This is also my first time working in a large team for programming,
whearas I usually program alone or in pairs. This is the kind of experience I need in order to work in software development industries.
The team members were very kind and helpful. Thanks to this project, I learned and applied agile planning, and gained even more experience
in web programming than I already had. I'll be able to work with frameworks from now on.
