This project has introduced me to the latest web standards such as MDL framework and web API technology.  
I could not have learned these technologies on my own without being exposed to a project like this. 
In addition, the project has also taught me how agile methodologies work and applied in a project to produce
a working software in a short period time. Overall, this has been a fantastic project to be a part of. 
It has been a pleasure working with the team who could not have been more helpful.
