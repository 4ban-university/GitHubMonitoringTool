Overall, I was able to learn a lot from this project. From the usage of libraries 
such as mdl and bootstraps, to understanding the concepts of API calling, this project
allowed me to experience an environment similar to industrial software development. 
It also enabled to apply concepts of software development and planning learnt in class.
