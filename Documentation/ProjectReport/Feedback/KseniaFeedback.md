This project was a very valuable experience for me for many reasons. First of all, I improved my skills in Javascript. My task was to display the data from the GitHub with charts and tables, so I needed to figure out how to do it and create some algorithms. Secondly, the project idea was to apply Scrum model to our development process, and this should be a very useful experience in the future. And finally, we have a great team. We had a lot of meetings and communicated with Slack, so we always stayed in touch. Everyone could get help with any part of the project and everyone did what he was supposed to do. We completed everything on time without any conflicts or delays, what is why I am very satisfied with this project.
