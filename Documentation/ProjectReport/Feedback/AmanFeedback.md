The project provided an abundance of experience in the realm of software development and enforced the importance of project planning. This was my first time using the agile development method and working with a large team in developing an application from the ground up. Our team's ability to effectively coordinate tasks and utilize the strengths of individual team members allowed for a seamless planning and implementation of the e-learning application. Due to the positive impact of this project I will use the methods learned and utilize it in future development projects.
