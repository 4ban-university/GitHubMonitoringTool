The usage of the library mdl was a challenge since mdl is not widely used by many developers,
there were components that were not compatible with every browser. Some parts are using bootstraps
to ensure that the functionality of the web app was available through all browsing platforms. Working with 
GitHub was also a challenge. I have not worked with any software development platform before. 
There was a period of time needed to get use to GitHub and to learn the functionality of the website.
Another challenge was to work with new concepts such as making API calls.
