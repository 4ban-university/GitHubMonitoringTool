The main challenge areas involved setting up the testing environment and assigning story points. The test environment was difficult as it involved learning QUnit, a JavaScript unit testing framework, and creating test cases for each of the JavaScript functions. Learning and understanding the steps involved in setting up QUnit were facilitated by the framkework's documentation and assistance from members of our team. Additionally, the creation of test cases were carried out using the partition method which assisted in ensuring that outlier and normal cases were tested accordingly. Another challenge area involved assigning story points to user stories, especially during our first planning poker session where we did not understand our system nor our ability to implement the features. However, as we moved through the sprints and development cycles were able to assign story points more accurately and we were able to deliver on our individual tasks.
