During this project, I faced several challenges. 
First, I was not familiar with Git or Github, so I had to learn how to use it. It was completely new to me,
so it was a bit difficult at first. 
Second, I had to learn frameworks for the user interface. At first I learned how to use Bootstrap, but we had some changes 
for the project and we ended up changing frameworks, since we switched to Material Design Lite. So I had to learn how that 
Material Design Lite worked.
Thanks to those, I've gained new knowledge on how to work on and design user interfaces.
