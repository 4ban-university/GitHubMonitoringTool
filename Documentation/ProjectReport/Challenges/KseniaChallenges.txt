I met a few challenges during this project.
1. Work with Promises when I needed to use the data from them and it was not visible outside Promises.
2. Chart type switch, because I needed to destroy the existing chart before that, but charts plugin. 
3. Sorting of the data, because it is represented in object with different properties and it is not possible to make data sorted with one of the object properties.
