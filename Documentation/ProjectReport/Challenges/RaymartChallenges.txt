I faced are two different challenges during the course of the project. 
First, learning Material Design Lite (MDL) framework for the front-end development. 
This is framework is all new to me. However, I did quite a bit of work in Bootstrap, a framework similar to MDL. 
I've been using Bootstrap in my own projects. So, this was not a surprise for me. 
It took me a couple of hours to learn the basics and finally applied them to the project. 
Second, understanding and learning about web application programming interface (API) especially GitHub API. 
GitHub API is the main web API used in the project, thus, I had to read the API documentation and make sense 
how are we going to employ their usage in our project. Fortunately, playing around with GitHub's OAuth authorization 
API helps me understand API application better, as well as its relevance
in other projects.
